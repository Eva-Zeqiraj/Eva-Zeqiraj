### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Solving real-world problems regarding data structures, transformations and predictions is my passion.  As a physics graduate, I have a broad general understanding of scientific domains, and as such, I have experience analyzing and solving problems in many different contexts. I love to dive into new technologies and learn new programming skills on my way to completing a task. 

As a person, I am outgoing and thrives on teamwork since I get inspired by others. At the same time, I enjoy taking the initiative, being proactive and communicating my ideas with those around me. I like taking on new challenges and coming up with innovative solutions.
