### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Solving real-world problems regarding data structures, transformations and predictions is my passion.  As a physics graduate, I have a broad general understanding of scientific domains, and as such, I have experience analyzing and solving problems in many different contexts. I love to dive into new technologies and learn new programming skills on my way to completing a task.
